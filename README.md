# Advanced-Java-Final
This project was completed for my Advanced Java course for my programming degree in university. It is designed to create a system hooked into a sql database
populated with faker data, that allows customers to select "products" from a database and add them to a receipt. You can then "checkout". On the receipt, 
there are edit buttons that allow you to change the quantity of items, or you can delete the receipt and return to shopping. The databases will have to be
changed to databases you created in order to run this.
